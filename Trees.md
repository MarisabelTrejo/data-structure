# Introduction
Just like linked lists nodes are connected together by pointers, so are **Trees**. The difference is that a tree can connect to multiple different nodes. 
## Types of Trees
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- Binary Balanced Search Trees

## Example - Family Tree
This family tree has a certain order it needs to go in. Nonetheless, they are all connected.

# Binary Search Trees
The parent node is the first node that is on top. If the tree is blank and we are **adding** a value to the tree, then the first added value would become the **parent** node. As we add more values, we compare them to the parent node. If they a **greater** then the value would go on the right subtree. If it is **less** than the parent node, then it will go on the left side. **Duplicates** can go on either side.
**We always start at the root node and compare the new value with it. We keep comparing until we have found an empty place for the new node.**

# Lets Work Together
Lets practice how to insert nodes in our BST!

# Problem to Solve
Lets practice how to add duplicates to our binary search tree.
