# Introduction

Stacks follows the principle of first one in, last one out. The stack can be used to accomplish various tasks and can be implemented using a Python list.
**Pop and Push**: Each time we add something to the stack we **push** or in other words **“Append”**. Each time we remove from the stackwe **pop** it off or in other words **“Remove”**.
